# weeklyscheduler

Have you ever had trouble keeping track of time?
This app will help you keep track of your time again!!
When Opened you will be shown the hours of the day and in the colored boxes you will enter a Task that you need to complete at that time. And once you have all your tasks entered for the day you click the save button and all your tasks will be saved to local storage.
